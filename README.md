# LondonQuiz

It is a multi choice question game with facts related to London. 

The user is clicking or touching the possible answer and the score is being updated in each answer.

At the end the score is categorize among 4 tiers.

I use jQuery methods.

I use firebase store 50 questions with corresponding possible answers and  images. I use the firebase API to grab the data of 10 ramdon questions.  

I plan to add a way to save username with the score and to display in a Scoreboard.
